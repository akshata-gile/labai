% Prolog is a logic programming language that is particularly well-suited for implementing systems based on predicate logic. Implementing an expert system in Prolog involves defining rules and facts that represent the knowledge base of the system, and then querying this knowledge base to obtain answers or make inferences. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement an expert system in Prolog:
% 1.	Define the Knowledge Base: Start by defining the knowledge base of your expert system. This includes defining facts and rules that represent the relationships and logic of the domain you are modeling.
% 2.	Define Facts: Facts are statements about the domain that are assumed to be true. In Prolog, facts are represented as predicates without any arguments. 
% 3.	Define Rules: Rules define relationships between facts and can be used to make inferences. Rules are represented using the :- operator. 
% 4.	Define Queries: Queries are used to ask questions or make inferences from the knowledge base. You can query the knowledge base using the Prolog interpreter to obtain answers. 
% 5.	Consult the Prolog File: Save your Prolog code in a .pl file and consult it within the Prolog interpreter using the consult/1 predicate. 
% 6.	Query the Knowledge Base: Once the file is consulted, you can start querying the knowledge base to obtain answers or make inferences.
% 7.	Test and Refine: Test your expert system with various queries and refine it as needed based on the results. We may need to add more facts or rules to improve the accuracy of the system.
% Code:
% % Define symptoms
% symptom(fever).
% symptom(headache).
% symptom(rash).
% symptom(nausea).
% symptom(vomiting).
% symptom(diarrhea).
% symptom(fatigue).
% symptom(abdominal_pain).
% symptom(chest_pain).
% symptom(shortness_of_breath).

% % Define diseases and their associated symptoms
% disease(measles) :-
%     symptom(fever),
%     symptom(rash).
% disease(meningitis) :-
%     symptom(fever),
%     symptom(headache),
%     symptom(nausea),
%     symptom(vomiting).
% disease(gastroenteritis) :-
%     symptom(nausea),
%     symptom(vomiting),
%     symptom(diarrhea),
%     symptom(abdominal_pain),
%     symptom(fatigue).
% disease(angina) :-
%     symptom(chest_pain),
%     symptom(shortness_of_breath).

% % Define the main function to diagnose the disease based on symptoms
% diagnose(Disease) :-
%     disease(Disease),
%     write('The patient may have '), write(Disease), nl.
% diagnose(_) :-
%     write('Unable to diagnose the disease based on the given symptoms.'), nl.

% how to run
% 1) consult('file_name.pl')
% 2) diagnose(measles)
% 3) diagnose(disease), symptom(fever), symptom(rash)
